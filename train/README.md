# Overview

ðŸ”¥ Application now supports different checkpoints from YOLOv8, YOLOv9 and YOLOv10 architectures.

YOLOv8 is a powerful neural network architecture that provides both decent accuracy of predictions and high speed of inference. In comparison to YOLOv5, YOLOv8 uses an anchor-free head (allowing to speed up the non-max suppression (NMS) process), a new backbone, and new loss functions.

YOLOv9 builds on the advancements of YOLOv8 by further improving the model's performance and efficiency. It incorporates extended feature extraction techniques, advanced loss functions and optimized training processes for better accuracy and faster inference times.

YOLOv10, the latest iteration, introduces consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training and adopts a holistic efficiency-accuracy-driven model design strategy.

This app allows you to train models using YOLOv8, YOLOv9 and YOLOv10 on a selected dataset. You can define model checkpoints, data split methods, training hyperparameters, data augmentation, and many other features related to model training. The app supports both models pretrained on COCO or Open Images V7 dataset and models trained on custom datasets. Supported task types include object detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation.

---

**Updates:**

- v1.0.60 - Extended support for Open Images V7 and YOLOv9 checkpoints.
- v1.0.63 - Added multiclass pose estimation support.
- v1.0.73 - Enabled support for freezing layers to allow more flexible model training.
- v1.0.87 - Integrated the YOLOv10 checkpoints.

# How To Run

Select images project, select GPU device in "Agent" field, click on `RUN` button:

# App Specifications

Please, remember that pose estimation task requires target object to be labeled by both graphs (keypoints) and bounding boxes (rectangles). For better experience, please, use [object binding](https://developer.supervisely.com/advanced-user-guide/objects-binding) to speed up the process of matching graphs and bounding boxes. If there are no binding keys in annotations, approach based on euclidian distance between centers of graphs and boxes will be used to match them with each other.

# How To Use Your Trained Model Outside Supervisely

You can use your trained models outside Supervisely platform without any dependencies on Supervisely SDK. See this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/yolov8/blob/master/outside_supervisely/inference_outside_supervisely.ipynb) for details.
